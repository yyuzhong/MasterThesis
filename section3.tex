\chapter{\uppercase{Related work}}
There are so many research scientists working in large oil \& gas companies and so many service companies, but in such a mature industry, it is very difficult to find complete open source codes or sample data on Internet. The main reason should be Intellectual Property issue; In the last twenty years, the oil \& gas becomes the most profitable industry. As there are less unexplored areas, how to find the valuable oilfield is the most important task for oil \& gas companies. With the intensifying competition, the exploration data became very expensive and every company either kept its technology secret or applied for patents to protect itself.    

In normal case of seismic data processing, most companies will both write their own algorithms and use commerical softwares such as MATLAB, Petrel from Schlumberger, Paradigm software suite etc. The previous ones are mostly used to verify and its own customized algorithms or models and could be optimized basing on requirement, on the other hand, commercial softwares are mainly used in migration and interpretation stages. As for the commerical softwares, most of them could only run on single node, the performance is critical problem while handling big data.  
Besides commerical softwares, there is a list of free geophysics software in \cite{listofgeosw}. Among them the most famous one is Seismic Unix (SU) \cite{SUHome}.
SU provides a series of tools for seismic data processing and uses stdin/stdout for IO. SEPlib \cite{SEPlibHome} contains programs to manipulate and process many types of geophysical data. Madagascar \cite{MadagascarHome} is a moden package that provide a powerful for multidimensional data analysis and reproducible computational experiments.
