It is impossible for me to finish this dissertation without the guidance of committee members, help from my friends, all colleagues in our cloud computing lab, and support from my family.

At first, I would like to expresss my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Lei Huang, for his professional guidance, giving this chance to study at PVAMU and providing first class environment for our research. I also want to thank Dr. Yang and Dr. Bellam, for they have spent lots of time on reviewing my theis and have given so much excellent suggestions. Special thanks to Dr. Li, for his outstanding teaching in programming language and algorithms classes and his kind guidance as graduate program coordinator.

I also would like to say thanks for all colleagues and classmates working in cloud coputing lab; Besides technology parts, I have learned a lot things from them about culture in different countries, and our lab is filled with sweat smell of coffee and happiness everyday. Thank my friend Lulu Shi and her family in special, for they help me settle down at Houston when I came here at first time, inviting me have dinner countless times and help our family solve many problems in life.

Finally, I want to thanks my wife, Sanni Jia and my son, Thomas Yan. Sanni quited her job and brought our lovely son from China to a totally new world, United States for giving me powerful supports. I could not overcome so much difficulty without them. Thanks to my parent for giving me life and supports without asking for return. Thanks for my sister, Yuqin Yan, for taking all responsibility of caring for my parents that let me worry-free.
